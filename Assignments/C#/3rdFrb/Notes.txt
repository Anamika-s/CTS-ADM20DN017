The enum can be of any numeric data type such as byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, or ulong. However, an enum cannot be a string type.

Specify the type after enum name as : type. The following defines the byte enum.

Example: byte Enum
enum Categories: byte
{
    Electronics = 1,  
    Food = 5, 
    Automotive = 6, 
    Arts = 10, 
    BeautyCare = 11, 
    Fashion = 15
}
